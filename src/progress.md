# Disease progression

Everyone suffers from a disease at some point. The lucky amongst us
avoid anything more serious than {index}`influenza`, {index}`measles`,
or (in my case, years ago) {index}`whooping cough`. But all diseases
share some common characteristics: characteristics so common, in fact,
that their mathematical properties are shared by other processes that
aren't actually diseases at all, including the spread of
{index}`computer viruses <computer virus>` {cite}`KW91` and the
spread of rumours and other information.

```{margin}
Diseases that must be vectored through animals to infect humans are
also known as **zoonoses**.
```
The diseases in which we are interested are caused by
*{index}`pathogens <pathogen>`*, typically viruses or bacteria: simple
living organisms that make their homes in humans (or other living
organisms) and cause some adverse reaction as a result of their
lifecycle. These pathogens can {index}`pass <transmission;modes of transmission>`
between individuals in a number of ways, causing the
disease to spread. A disease might be **airborne**, able to live in
the air and be breathed by passing individuals. It might be spread by
**droplets**, coughed and sneezed into the environment or deposited on
objects and picked up by future physical contact with the contaminated
surfaces. Or it might be communicable only by **direct physical
contact**, skin to skin, through sex, or a blood transfusion. It might
be **foodborne**, transmitted through contaminated food that infects
several people from a common source. It might be **vectored** through
an animal, as is the case for {index}`malaria` which has to be sporead by
mosquitoes and can't spread person-to-person. Even diseases that don't
*require* a vector may still incubate in animal hosts *as well* as in
humans (this is suspected in the {index}`case <Spanish flu>` of the
[1918 "Spanish flu"
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic)
{cite}`OSJ02`). And finally there is a class of **non-communicable**
diseases such as cancer or heart disease, some of which are
**hereditary**: not caused directly by pathogens but perhaps
influenced by their presence, and perhaps made worse by infections.

A disease becomes an **{index}`epidemic`** when it infects a substantial
fraction of a population within a short time. There's no universally
accepted definition of how large a fraction is needed to classify an
outbreak as an epidemic: for new or rare diseases even a small number
of infections might be considered an epidemic, while some diseases
persist in a population at a low level and then flare-up
epidemically. If an epidemic infects people in several populations --
typically several countries or several continents -- than it is termed
a **{index}`pandemic`**.

Each different kind of disease will have its own characteristic
**{index}`pathology`**, how it affects the body of a person infected. It will
also have its own **{index}`epidemiology`** that controls how it
spreads. Clinically, both these characteristics are extremely
important; we will focus here on the epidemiology, but the pathology
remains important because factors involved in how a disease
progresses *in* individuals may have a profound effect on how it
spreads *between* individuals.

## Disease progression

A person's infection goes through several periods, starting with their
**{index}`disease progression;infection`**. Once infected, the disease resides
**{index}`latent <disease progression;latent period>`** in their system, developing its
presence but not showing symptoms and not being infectious to
others. After this latent period the disease becomes
**{index}`infectious <disease progression;infectious period>`**, capable of being spread
to others. Typically a person's infectiousness peaks and dies away
before the end of the disease progression.

![Disease stages](disease-periods.png)

These two periods &ndash; latent and infectious &ndash; control the
**{index}`transamission`** of infection. After initial infection there
will be an **{index}`disease progression;incubation period`** before the person shows
symptoms of the disease. After the onset of symptoms, the disease
progresses and ends in some **{index}`disease progression;resolution`**: the patient gets better,
or dies. If they recover, they may then have some immunity to further
infection.

For different diseases, the lengths of these periods and the ways they
overlap vary. For **Type A** diseases, the incubation period is longer
than the latent period. This means that a patient can start to
transmit the disease before the disease becomes manifest in
themselves. This happens in cases of {index}`measles` and
{index}`covid-19`. In **Type B** diseases such as {index}`SARS` or
{index}`ebola`, by contrast, the incubation period is shorter than the
latent period, meaning that asymptomatic patients cannot infect
others. So despite ebola being a more feared disease than measles, it
may be easier to treat epidemiologically since quarantining patients
showing symptoms will prevent transmission in the general population
(although not to medical staff); in measles, transmission starts
before symptoms show themselves, so quarantine based on symptoms is
less effective. Moreover for some disease the infectious period may
continue after the patient has died: the corpses of victims of ebola,
which is transmitted *via* bodily fluids, can be extremely infectious
for some time after death, meaning that funerals become very dangerous
loci of potential infection for mourners.

```

How long do the different periods last? For each disease there will be
typical durations, often with substantial {index}`variance`. In the case of
{index}`ebola`, for example, a typical timeline would be a 0&ndash;3 day
incubation period, a 7&ndash;12 day progression to recovery or death,
and a latent period of 2&ndash;5 days. The ranges give the variance of
periods, different for different individuals that depend on factors
including the severity of infection and the individual's overall
health. However, the incubation period for ebola can be up to 21 days,
meaning that a suspected case needs to be quarantined for this period:
long enough, in other words, for the disease symptoms to manifest if
the person is actually infected. While one can test for most diseases
(including ebola) in a laboratory, during an epidemic such tests may
overwhelm the public health infrastructure, making {index}`quarantine` the most
practical option. (During historical disease outbreaks, of course,
quarantine was the *only* option.)

## Measuring and modelling epidemics

{index}`Epidemiology <epidemiology>` is the science of creating models
of diseases and their spread that can be analysed, to make predictions
or to simulate the effects of different responses. To do this, we need
to identify the core elements of a disease from the perspective of
transmission: we typically do not need to understand the disease's
detailed biology, only the timings and other factors that affect its
spread.

We discussed above the periods of diseases, their relationships, and
their different characteristics. We need some other numbers as well,
however, and it turns out that these can be measured directly in the
field.

The most important number is the **{index}`basic case reproduction number <see: basic case reproduction number;R value>`**,
denoted $\mathcal{R}_0$. $\mathcal{R}_0$ represents the total number of secondary
infections expected for each primary infection in a totally
susceptible population. The $0$ in $\mathcal{R}_0$ stands for $t = 0$:
the basic case reproduction number applies at the start of an epidemic. Over the
course of an epidemic the value of $\mathcal{R}$ will change as people become
immune post-infection, countermeasures take effect, and so forth, and
give rise to a **{index}`net case reproduction number <see: net case
reproduction number;R value>`**
indicating how the disease is {index}`reproducing <R value>` at a given time.

$\mathcal{R}$ is affected by three factors:

1. The **duration of infectiousness**. All other things being equal, a
disease with a longer period of infectiousness has more time in which
to infect other patients.
2. The **probability of {index}`transmission`** at each contact. Some diseases are
extremely contagious, with each contact having a high probability of
passing on the infection; others are much harder to pass on to
secondary cases.
3. The **rate of {index}`contact <contacts>`**. Someone coming into contact with more
susceptible individuals will have more opportunities to generate a
secondary case than someone meeting fewer.
s

The first two factors are characteristic of the disease, derived from
its biology. The third is characteristic of the social conditions in
which the epidemic takes place: it is this factor that {doc}`physical distancing <distancing>`,
{index}`quarantine` and so forth affect, by
reducing (ideally to zero) the contacts an infected person has with
uninfected individuals.


(sec:progress-r)=
## The importance of $\mathcal{R}$

The importance of $\mathcal{R}$ is that it indicates whether, and how fast, a
disease can spread through a susceptible population. If $\mathcal{R} < 1$ then
we expect fewer than one secondary case per primary. This means that
each "{index}`generation`" of the disease will be smaller than the one that
infected it, and the disease will die out. If $\mathcal{R} = 1$ then the
disease will perpetuate itself in whatever size of population was
originally infected. Nature is never so precise as to present us with
a disease like this, of course. However, $\mathcal{R} = 1$ is the
**{index}`threshold` value** at which diseases become epidemics. If $\mathcal{R} > 1$, the
disease will break-out and infect more and more people.

Exactly *how* quickly depends on how large $\mathcal{R}$ is. For {index}`measles`, $\mathcal{R}
\ge 15$ &ndash; fifteen new infections for each case &ndash; which
explains how measles spread so quickly in unvaccinated
populations. Different strains of {index}`influenza` have different ranges of
$R$: for the 1918 "{index}`Spanish flu`" it has been
estimated {cite}`VTM07` that $1.2 \le \mathcal{R} \le 3.0$ in the community
(although substantially more in confined settings). If this sounds
benign, remember that this epidemic killed substantially more people
than did the First World War.

In a typical epidemic the number of people infected grows *very*
quickly. If $\mathcal{R} = 2$ then one person infects two others, who
each infect two others, who each ... and so on -- so each generation
is twice as big as the last). If you plot the size of the epidemic
against time on a graph, it'll draw out an **{index}`exponential curve <exponential growth>`**.


(sec:progress-r-care)=
## Why we need to be careful about $\mathcal{R}$

This sounds like good news: if we know $\mathcal{R}$, we can estimate the size
of the epidemic we're facing; if we calculate it on an on-going basis
we can monitor how well any countermeasures we deploy are working, and
decide when to relax those countermeasures.

Well, not quite. There are at least four reasons that mean we need to
be careful not to over-rely on $\mathcal{R}$.

```{margin}
This reason actually drives all the rest, because it acts as an
amplifier for everything concerning $\mathcal{R}$.
```
The first reason is mathematical. $\mathcal{R}$ is the exponent of the equation
that controls the epidemic's size. This is important, because it means
that epidemics behave **non-linearly**. An $\mathcal{R}$ value of 4 is not twice
as bad as an $\mathcal{R}$ value of 2: the epidemic isn't twice as big, **it
doubles twice as many times** in the same period. Small differences in
the value of $\mathcal{R}$ therefore have huge effects.

It's true that $\mathcal{R} = 1$ is the critical value, below which an
epidemic dies out. But it doesn't follow from this that an
$\mathcal{R}$ value slightly over 1 is "pretty much 1" and so not a
worry. **That non-linearity means that even a {index}`small excess <sensitivity>`
in $\mathcal{R}$ can lead to a large
outbreak**. This has implications for epidemic control too: reducing
the $\mathcal{R}$ value to just below 1 isn't an indication that
everything will then be fine, as a small increase may set things off
again.

The second reason concerns estimation. The most effective way of
estimating $\mathcal{R}$ is {doc}`contact tracing <tracing>`, where
infected individuals' {index}`contacts <contact tracing>` are located and tested &ndash; and can
then be treated or isolated if found to be infected
themselves. Careful and widespread "{index}`test, trace, and isolate`"
strategies can be extremely effective in reducing an epidemic. The
number of infected contacts individuals have on average lets us
estimate of $\mathcal{R}$.

But by definition **test and trace is "counting in the rear view
mirror"**. It tells us how many people *were being* infected, not how
many people *are being* infected. There will be a delay in identifying
infected individuals, further delay in finding and testing their
contacts, and so forth. If circumstances are changing, for example
through pathogen evolution or it infecting different social settings,
the estimate will be rendered out of date.

The third reason concerns the consequences of errors. **Finding,
tracing, and counting of infected individuals is invariably
error-prone**. People will be missed; tests are never 100% accurate,
especially for diseases with long incubation periods where there may
be low pathogen loads in the early stages; individuals forget whom
they were in contact with; tracing apps don't work in all
circumstances; and so forth. Each of these errors leads to
under-counting secondary infections and therefore under-estimating
$\mathcal{R}$.

Finally we must remember that $\mathcal{R}$ is the *average* number of secondary
cases per primary. The use of averaging (and indeed other summary
statistics) is essential when trying to get the "big picture" of an
epidemic. But it means that the value of $\mathcal{R}$ reported depends not just
on the disease but on the population being {index}`averaged <averaging>` over.

To see what this might mean, consider a country consisting of one city
surrounded by a collection of small villages &ndash; London in the
Middle Ages might be a good example. Suppose the disease breaks out
ferociously in the city but, because they are separated and take
precautions, the villages see a much sparser rate of infection. If we
were to compute the net case reproduction rate *averaged over the city*
we'd capture all the ferocity of the epidemic's spread. But if we
compute the rate *over the whole country*, we'd see a far milder
epidemic. Because the same disease is spreading in different
circumstances, averaging may be misleading &ndash; too mild for the
city, but too large for the countryside. **When interpreting an
average, you always need to know what population has been averaged
over**. It is possible to manipulate the reported $\mathcal{R}$ value
accidentally, or deliberately by judicious choice of population.

For all these reasons it's important not to fixate on $\mathcal{R}$. The fact
that it's a number can sometimes give a false sense of security,
because numbers suggest certainty and precision &ndash; and measuring
$\mathcal{R}$ in the midst of an on-going epidemic offers neither. A value of
$\mathcal{R}$ that's reducing over time is a good sign. But $\mathcal{R}$ falling &ndash;
or *seeming* to fall &ndash; below 1 isn't enough to prove that
countermeasures are working and can be relaxed.


(sec:progress-rate)=
## Growth rates

You may have noticed that the definition of $\mathcal{R}$ doesn't
include time. It's essentially the ratio of the different sizes of two
"generations" of infection, and so tells us about the way the disease
reproduces itself in a population. But it *doesn't* tell us *how fast*
that reproduction happens: how long does it take for the "next
generation" to come along?

Obviously the answer is something to do with the
{ref}`latent period <sec:progress-periods>` we looked at earlier. The shorter the latent
period, the faster an infected person becomes infectious, and the
faster the epidemic will grow. $\mathcal{R}$ tells us nothing useful
about this rate of growth.

Clearly this rate matters for tackling an outbreak, as well as for
modelling the progress of a disease in time. For this reason it's
common to use another, complementary measure of epidemic behaviour.

When we talked about the {ref}`exponential growth <sec:progress-r>` in
epidemic size, we were still thinking in terms of generations of
disease. We can think in "real" time instead.

Mathematically, the size of an epidemic can be expressed as

$$
    N(t) \propto e^{\lambda t}
$$

where $N(t)$ is the number of cases at time $t$ (measured in some
units) and $\lambda$ is the **{index}`growth rate`**, the number of new cases
that appear per unit of time. The utility of this is that if we know
the growth rate per day *and* we know how many disease cases we have
*now*, we can predict how many diseases cases we'll have *later*,
tomorrow (or even farther into the future) -- and more importantly
we'll know the answer in terms of days, not in terms of disease
generations. Even more importantly, we can get $\lambda$ directly from
time series such as the number of diagnoses cases by **fitting** a
theoretical curve to the collected data.

```{margin}
A threshold value is an example of what mathematicians call a
*{index}`seperatrix`*, a value that divides two regimes of qualitatively
different behaviour -- growing or shrinking, in this case.
```
Just as $\mathcal{R}$ had a {index}`threshold` at $\mathcal{R} = 1$ that
determined whether the epidemic was growing or shrinking, so $\lambda
= 1$ divides growing ($\lambda > 1$) from shrinking ($\lambda <
0$) conditions. And just like $\mathcal{R}$, we need to be careful
about reading too much into that: mistakes or omissions in reporting
the ongoing cases can easily cause an over- or under-estimate of
$\lambda$.

The values of $\mathcal{R}$ and $\lambda$ are mathematically related,
of course, with the former being found by integrating the latter
{cite}`WL07`. In fact we can make $\lambda$ capture just the
biological part of the disease's spread, while capturing things like
social issues and countermeasures separately as a probability
distribution of infections over time.


## Questions for discussion

- Think of a disease you've had. How did you catch it? Could you have
  done anything to *avoid* catching it? Was it made worse by where you
  lived at the time?
- What can be done to cope with "Type A" diseases, where people can
  {index}`transmit <transmission>` the disease without showing symptoms of it?
- Do you think the $\mathcal{R}$ number is a useful thing to keep track of
  during an epidemic? Why? (Or why not?)
